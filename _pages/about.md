I am a final year PhD student in the [Mathematic for Real-World Systems CDT](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/mathsys/) at the University of Warwick, where I am currently supervised by [Theo Damoulas](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/staff/academic-research/damoulas/), and previously by [Rich Savage](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/cross_fac/zeeman_institute/staffv2/savage). I am also a Visiting Researcher at the London based [Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/), having previously done an enrichment year there. I have also completed a placement at [Prowler.io](https://www.prowler.io/) in Cambridge working with ST John and James Hensman on a research project. My main area of research is in Probabilistic Machine Learning. I work on developing novel modelling and inference methodolgies for probabilistic models, with a particular focus on Gaussian process models.

## Research Interests:
* Gaussian Processes
* Multitask and Transfer Learning
* Bayesian Inference (mainly Variational Inference)
* Probabilistic Modelling
* Sequential Monte Carlo
* Continual and Online Learning
* Variance Reduction
