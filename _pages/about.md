I am a research scientist at [causaLens](https://www.causalens.com/), working on fundemental and applied research in machine learning and causality. I completed my PhD in probabilistic machine learning at the [Mathematic for Real-World Systems CDT](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/mathsys/) at the University of Warwick, where I was supervised by [Theo Damoulas](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/staff/academic-research/damoulas/), and previously by [Rich Savage](https://www.pinpointdatascience.com/team). I was also a Visiting Researcher at the London based [Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/) and an intern at [Secondmind.ai](https://www.secondmind.ai/) in Cambridge, where I worked with ST John and James Hensman. My main area of fundemental research is in Probabilistic Machine Learning and I have also been recently looking into the interface between Causality and Reinforcment learning.

## Research Interests:
* Probabilsitic models mainly Gaussian Processes
* Bayesian inference (mainly Variational Inference)
* Causality and reinforcment learning
* Multitask and transfer Learning
* Sequential Monte Carlo
* Continual and online learning
* Variance reduction
