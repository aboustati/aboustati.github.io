Hi! I am Ayman! Welcome to my webpage! Here is a bit of information about me if you're curious :) 

I am a third year PhD student in the [Mathematic for Real-World Systems CDT](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/mathsys/) at the University of Warwick, where I am currently supervised by [Theo Damoulas](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/staff/academic-research/damoulas/), and previously by [Rich Savage](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/cross_fac/zeeman_institute/staffv2/savage). I have recently finished a placement in [Prowler.io](https://www.prowler.io/) in Cambridge working with ST John and James Hensman. Prior, I was based in London at the [Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/) as an enrichment student. My main area of research is in Probabilistic Machine Learning. I work on developing methodolgies for transfer learning and multitask learning for Gaussian Process models (of the shallow and deep varieties!). I am also interested in inference in probabilistic models in general, especially scalable methods such as  Variational Inference.

## Research Interests:
* Gaussian Processes
* Multitask and Transfer Learning
* Bayesian Inference (mainly Variational Inference)
* Probabilistic Modelling
* Representation Learning
